Free Market Protocol seeks to revolutionize on-chain user experience by providing the middleware infrastructure to automate, integrate, and execute workflows. As an orchestration layer, Free Market runs air-traffic control for multi-step workflows, allowing seamless execution between multiple dapps, even in cross-chain transactions.
Our flexible and extensible workflow engine gives protocols, users, traders, and builders the ability to create their own automated workflows. Available through our SDK and our no-code platform, Free Market serves as the foundation for a range of user types to build the quality of life improvements they need in the on-chain world.

This monorepo consists of 2 components:

- [engine](/engine) The workflow engine. This is the core of the protocol and is responsible for executing workflows.
- [client-sdk](/client-sdk) A typescript library that abstracts the low level details of the Engine and enables easy authoring of workflows
